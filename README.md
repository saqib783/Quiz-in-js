## 🧩 How the Quiz Logic Works

- Quiz data is stored in an **array of objects**
- Each object contains:
  - `question`
  - `options`
  - `correct` (index of the correct answer)
- When a user clicks:
  - The selected option is checked
  - Correct or wrong class is applied
  - Clicking **Next** loads the next question
